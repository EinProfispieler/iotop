--- history of finished TODO items ---

- Show prio of processes with threads as !be/4
- Third mode proc+threads, to show threads under the process [change the threads mode instead of adding 3rd mode]
- Add some gap between pseudo-graph and command line; use the gap to visually group threads of the same process
- Aggregate thread data in process mode
- Edit pid/user filters from interactive mode
- Let 0 show all columns
- Scrolling for the main view by UP/DOWN/PGUP/PGDN
- Document exited threads/process display
- Document the display of processes with different prio (e.g. !be/4)
- Document the sorting order in thread view (threads always go after their main process)
- Document pid/user filters interactive interface
- Document 0 shows all columns
- Document -u +123 command line
- Document scrolling
- Add scroll bar
- Rework help to be like popup window
- Add all missing keys to help window
- Freezed, scrollable view of procs/threads for ionice selection (abandoned idea - exited processes should be kept track of)
- ESC key close the help dialog
- let the warning window about missing task_delayacct be closed by any key press and reappear on state change
- add a small red indicator for missing kernel support for swapin/io
- mask swapin/io columns and io graph data source if kernel support is disabled
- do not sort on masked columns but continue to sort on hidden ones
- add read/write/read+write data sources for the graph
- add a toggle to select graph data source (as a side effect option 'only' will use the same)
- restore some form of visible help on the bottom
